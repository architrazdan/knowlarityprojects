           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
           This module implements a number of Python exceptions you can raise from
           within your views to trigger a standard non-200 response.
       
       
           Usage Example
           -------------
       
           ::
       
               from werkzeug.wrappers import BaseRequest
               from werkzeug.wsgi import responder
               from werkzeug.exceptions import HTTPException, NotFound
       
               def view(request):
                   raise NotFound()
       
               @responder
               def application(environ, start_response):
                   request = BaseRequest(environ)
                   try:
                       return view(request)
                   except HTTPException as e:
                       return e
       
       
           As you can see from this example those exceptions are callable WSGI
           applications.  Because of Python 2.4 compatibility those do not extend
           from the response objects but only from the python exception class.
       
           As a matter of fact they are not Werkzeug response objects.  However you
           can get a response object by calling ``get_response()`` on a HTTP
           exception.
       
           Keep in mind that you have to pass an environment to ``get_response()``
           because some errors fetch additional information from the WSGI
           environment.
       
           If you want to hook in a different exception page to say, a 404 status
           code, you can add a second except for a specific subclass of an error::
       
               @responder
               def application(environ, start_response):
                   request = BaseRequest(environ)
                   try:
                       return view(request)
                   except NotFound, e:
                       return not_found(request)
                   except HTTPException, e:
                       return e
